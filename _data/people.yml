  text: "Ken is broadly interested in marine invertebrate evolution. By combining genomic and bioinformatic tools with organismal biology, he has explored questions of deep animal phylogeny, chemosynthetic ecosystems, population genomics, and Antarctic biology. He is involved on a number of fronts with promoting the use of genomic and informatics to better understand marine systems. Those interested in joining the lab should contact him."
